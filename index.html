              <p class="card-text text-justify" style="white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.8;">
                Once, within those star- and destiny-filled fields, where fate keeps interlinking life paths in the most unimagined way, I found Sara. It was during a wedding of a friend, full of color, light, and music, where every hue danced together in a thousand shades. In that ocular treat, she was sitting—mysterious, yet shining; carrying an entire world within her, an intensity that silently breathed to which my gaze would naturally flow.
  
                It felt like a nonevent, as if we had known each other all our lives. Sure enough, our eyes met across the terrace, and in that instant, something silent passed between us. Her laughter was warm, embers glowing in soft light; her smile open in a way I secretly felt was rare (jerry smile w pressure cooker laugh). I told her my name, and then we were moving under the stars, sharing little pieces of our worlds.
  
              Sara had a story unlike any other. She was born away, in the middle of warm days melting into serene evenings. Simple, her early life wasn't, from dealing with monsters unseen knocking on doors at night to the seen ones who roamed around her house freely, and it shaped her in ways she was still discovering. At the age of fourteen after a tiresome battle with herself she moved, leaving behind mother and life that wasn't one to be admired. There her father waited for her: strange in many ways, at the same time a tie to the person she was becoming.
  
                It was hard for Sara to settle into this. This new home had unfamiliar rhythms and sounds, and something she thought she left behind waited in another horrifying form for her there.A rocky relationship with father as they clashed fiercely over their stubborn adherence to thoughts.
  
                But even in the storms, something of her was breaking through. She was quiet, a force so often found unto herself, though not often in class, she was known for her mind, her quiet brilliance and her wit.
  
                What then caught my attention was her compassion: the deep love for animals, mainly the two cats that had kept her company. Rather, many other strays would also appear to cling to her, and she often went out, even at the break of dawn, just to feed them. She was like a protector of small and forgotten things and the things that didn't have hope left, an embodiment of acts of kindness. She laughed as she told me of her quirks: how she puts on one sock, then one shoe, before repeating with the other; her dislike of raisins. We shared a love of simple pleasures: tea and eggs. She told me cooking was her art, and I could almost imagine the meals she was describing (noodles and some more noodles).
  
                In that instant, I knew this was one of those women who could find beauty in everything, even the mundane, and spread that beauty wherever she went.Her ability to see the good in people but not herself baffled me the most.
  
                Days could be filled with busy work around the house, things many people wouldn't even think to do or would leave for someone else to do. She could handle anything that came her way,from ikea furniture to installing floor tiles, unafraid to tackle anything that needed to be done. Sara was resilient, deeply caring, with a strength that made her an unwavering force. And as we parted that night, she made me a better person as she colored me in her color because I found myself falling in love with cats, doing weird pronunciations . I clutched it as if for a token, a reminder of her—a girl with silent strength that had turned even her story into something beautiful and feral. And it is many years afterward, with that first evening, whenever the sight of a stray catches my eye or the fragrance of newly brewed coffee wafts into my nostrils, I am reminded of her. She'd been a fairytale sprung to life, a narrative that made the world for me feel richer, kinder, and endlessly more loving and bearable.
